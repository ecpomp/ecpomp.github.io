Plan to be a mentor or attendee at the first ECP OpenMP hackathon of 2020 at Georgia Institute of Technology [here] (http://jekyllrb.com).
Due to COVID-19, it had to be moved last week from April 20-24 to later during this summer. We expect that it will be in July. 
More updates will be coming. Feel free to send an email to ecpomphack@gmail.com if you have any questions.
